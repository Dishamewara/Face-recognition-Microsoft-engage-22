# Face-recognition-Microsoft-engage-22
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence by Name and Time of arrival of students.  It covers areas such as facial detection, scanning and comparing of images, alignment, recognition, finding location of face and giving information about that person, along with the development of a web application which takes live attendance from the web camera and give attendance report.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like name, in-time, and attendance digitally (more features can be added like out time, break time, gender, option to upload new images, login, signup etc.).
